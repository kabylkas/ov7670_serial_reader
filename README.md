# ov7670_serial_reader
Playing around with arduino and ov7670 camera. This is the script to receive a picture from the arduino to the host computer through serial.

Tweek the baudrate and just run `python capture_one_shot.py`

This should output a single shot from the arduino (assuming your arduino setup is working).
