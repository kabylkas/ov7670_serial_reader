## ov7670_serial_reader
Playing around with arduino and ov7670 camera. This is the script to receive a picture from the arduino to the host computer through serial.

Tweak the baudrate and serial port. Then, just run `python capture_one_shot.py`

This should output a single shot from the arduino (assuming your arduino setup is working).

## Script was running on:
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Python 2.7
